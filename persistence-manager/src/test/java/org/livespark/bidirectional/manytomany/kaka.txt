columns. One foreign key column refers to table A and has the same type as the primary key of
table A. The name of this foreign key column is formed as the concatenation of the following:
the name of entity A; "_"; the name of the primary key column in table A. The other foreign
key column refers to table B and has the same type as the primary key of table B and there is a
unique key constraint on it. The name of this foreign key column is formed as the concatena-
tion of the following: the name of the relationship property or field of entity A; "_"; the name
of the primary key column in table B.
